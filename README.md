# TASK-5

In this study, the Heart Disease dataset was used to build and evaluate a simple machine learning classification model. First, the dataset was split into training and testing sets, where the training set is used to teach the model the underlying patterns in the data, and the testing set is kept separate to evaluate how well the model performs on unseen data. This separation helps in checking the generalization ability of the model and avoids overfitting. A Logistic Regression model was then trained using the training data, as it is a commonly used algorithm for binary classification problems like predicting the presence or absence of heart disease. After training, the model was used to make predictions on the test dataset. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of predictions, precision indicates how many predicted heart disease cases were actually correct, and recall shows how well the model identifies actual heart disease cases. Finally, a confusion matrix was used to explain the classification results by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing a clear understanding of where the model performs well and where it makes errors.
